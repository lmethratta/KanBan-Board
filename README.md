# KanBan-Board:
-a project management tool 


Each kanban board was based on a project object, and each project had corresponding users and tasks. Users could be either project managers or developers, with access to certain functionalities such as deleting projects and tasks, limited by user role. The tasks unlocked based on user roles varied and included things such as building a grid and debugging a program. 

For testing purposes, we initialized two projects, Doodlebug and airplane. For users to interact with the project and task related capabilities, a main menu is presented to the user with options of opening up a project or quitting the kanban board. Once the user enters their username and password, the program checks if they are assigned to the project they chose. Given that they have correctly inputted all information, the user can choose to view and update information saved to text files, and the tasks are broken down by project (exp: delete project) and task related functions (exp: move task between statuses such as to-do and doing) . Before they can actually interact with any of the presented menu option tasks, based on project guidelines
